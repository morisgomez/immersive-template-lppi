    <h1><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h1>
    <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has had unimaginable health and economic impacts 
    with disproportionate effects on communities of color. Much less talked about 
    are the disproportionate disruptions that the pandemic has had on educational 
    attainment. Data from 2020 showed that almost a third of Black and Latino students
    had canceled their plans to continue their post-secondary education in the Fall of 2020, 
    a much higher rate than White students, which threatened to widen pre-existing racial 
    disparities in educational attainment.

    <p>A year later, the availability of vaccines and robust investments in pandemic recovery 
    offered renewed hope. In this factsheet, we analyze the racial disparities on the impact of COVID-19 
    on post-secondary education plans in 2021, and the effect of vaccine availability on these plans.

<! -- FIELD: OUR MAIN FINDINGS
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    <h2>Our main findings are:</h2>
    <ul>
         <li>Before vaccines were available, almost 11 percent of Latino 
            students planned to cancel all their plans of postsecondary 
            education in the Fall of 2021, compared to only 6.4 percent 
            of the total population. Multiethnic (11.3%), Black (10%), 
            and Asian (5.5%) students were also more likely to cancel 
            post-secondary plans than White students (5.4%).
        </li>
         <li>The vaccine rollout cut the share of students who planned to 
            cancel their post-secondary education by more than half across 
            all racial and ethnic groups. This means that while fewer students 
            of all races canceled their educational plans, the racial gaps in 
            educational disruption persisted after the vaccine.
        </li>
         <li>Inability to pay was the most cited reason for educational disruptions. 
            In addition, Multiethnic, Black, and Latino students were more likely to 
            cancel postsecondary education plans due to economic hardship than White 
            students, revealing another layer of the pandemic’s unequal distribution 
            of economic hardship. Almost 45 percent of Latino and Black students canceled 
            their educational plans because of changes in income due to the pandemic 
            compared to 38 percent of White students who did so. The vaccine rollout had little 
            impact on these rates.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The educational disparities reported in this factsheet, while spurred by COVID-19, reflect 
    and perpetuate the structural barriers that continue to limit opportunities for communities 
    of color to use higher education as a pathway to social and economic security. Delays and 
    reductions in higher education attainment, which are disproportionately borne by Black, Latino, 
    and Asian students, have negative cascading effects across the lifespan. Students who are forced to 
    delay their college plans are less likely to complete that degree, and face additional challenges to 
    school reentry the longer they must delay. Taking additional time to graduate college also creates 
    durable negative effects on salary and expected earnings after graduation.
    <br>
    The economic and social constraints on students of color have only intensified after a year in quarantine, a
    nd require increased federal and institutional support to rectify these systemic inequities. 
    A plan for post-COVID recovery at the university level cannot stop at a “return to campus,” but 
    rather in a deepened commitment to economic redistribution and opportunity for its most vulnerable students.

    <strong>
        Methodology
    </strong>
</h1>
<p> This analysis draws descriptive statistics from the US Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, an experimental data 
    product which aims to produce data on the social and economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic on American households.
    <span style="color: #005587;"><a style="color: #005587;" href="#_edn3" name="_endref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span>  
    Data was collected from Phase 3 of the Household Pulse Survey, when the Census Bureau expanded questions about educational 
    planning. Individual-level microdata was used to cross-tabulate racial characteristics against survey responses about future 
    college plans for respondents in the survey. Microdata was merged weekly between October 28, 2020 and March 29, 2021 encompassing 
    both the 2020 election, the inauguration of President Biden, and the approval of the coronavirus vaccine for the public.
    This data was then compared against a second tranche of Household Pulse Survey microdata from Phase 3.2 of survey data collection, 
    covering July 21-September 13, 2021. This dataset collected information from respondents after the vaccine became widely available 
    to the general public and after significant community spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.

        </a> 
    </span>Comparing responses before the vaccine was widely available and after community distribution also allows us to estimate the 
    distributional effect of the vaccine rollout across different racial and ethnic groups.

    <strong>
        Findings
    </strong>
</h1>
<p>
    The survey results show signs that although the pandemic threatened to exacerbate educational inequities in higher education, 
    he COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been successful in moderating some of those impacts. Across the board, though, Latinos and 
    multiethnic students continue to be the most likely to be unable to attend college in the fall or to have reduced the number
    of classes they planned on taking. Latinos and multiracial students were more likely to plan to cancel or postpone their studies 
    than students overall. As Figure 1 shows, 10.6% of Latinos in the survey originally stated that they had plans to cancel their enrollment 
    in postsecondary education in the fall of 2021, compared to only 6.4% of the total population. Multiethnic students and students of other 
    races were even more likely to plan to forgo college in the fall, at 11.3%. Nearly 10 percent of Black students (9.9%) also decided not to 
    attend post-secondary educational institutions the following fall. Asian and White students were the least likely to cancel their college or 
    postsecondary plans, at 5.5% and 5.4% respectively. The vaccine rollout reduced the number of survey respondents planning to forgo college-level 
    education by more than 50% across all ethnic groups. Some racial inequalities persist, but Latinos and Multiethnic students now face only single-digit 
    differences in college planning rates from their White counterparts.

    However, although the vaccine allowed more students of all ethnic groups to access post-secondary education, reductions in the number 
    of classes remained persistent after the vaccine became widely available. Among students who decided to attend or continue college in some form,
    Figure 2 indicates that Latinos and Multiethnic students were more likely to state that they planned to take fewer classes this coming fall, both 
    before and after the vaccine rollout. Post-vaccine, respondents were more likely to be taking their full intended course load than before, but only 
    at slightly higher rates.

    Inability to pay was the most cited reason for educational disruptions. Despite some gains granted by the COVID vaccine rollout, the economic impacts of the pandemic appear to be creating more 
    durable problems for students of color, potentially limiting academic attainment beyond 2021. As Figure 3 shows, around 40 percent of all students who decided to take fewer classes or forgo their 
    college plans in the Fall of 2021 did so for economic reasons. However, Latino students were nearly 5 percentage points more likely than the average student to have made that decision because they 
    were unable to pay for educational expenses due to pandemic-induced income changes. Black and Multiethnic students are also more likely to have been economically boxed out of their plans for higher 
    education. These findings provide additional evidence of the pandemic’s unequal distribution of economic hardship and the disproportionate impoverishment of Black and Latino communities over the 
    past year.
